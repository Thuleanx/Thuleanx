Week 1 of my Pixel Dailies practice. Pixel Dailies is a pixel art group that encourages people to practice pixel art every day. At the start of each day, a unique theme is announced, and everyone would produce 1 piece of pixel art related to the theme.

### Resistant

The first theme of the week is #resitant. Here resistant could relate to a variety of topics. Like a shield, a resistant movement / revolution, or immunity against diseases. Ultimately, I went for the most literal interpretation: resistance against an insurmountable foe.

I made this with the [Existential Demo](https://lospec.com/palette-list/existential-demo) palette, which turned out to be pretty versatile. Not sure if the background color I've chosen was appropriate for the artwork, but this was what I had for the first day.

### Wedding

#wedding is the theme for the second day. I was watching [mocca](https://www.twitch.tv/moccachan) earlier in the day and a bit about them marrying [ninaninin](https://www.twitch.tv/ninaninin) came up. I ran with this idea and made a small 32x32 piece with just 2 avatars and nina in a wedding dress.

Here I just used the respective vtuber's color palette. The yellow strain of hair on mocca's head turned out pinkish largely because everything was yellow on my monitor at night, so I didn't notice. Maybe I shouldn't push pixel dailies to be the last thing I do before bed.

### Fluffy

The third day had #fluffy as the theme. I thought of drawing a dog, since that's my favorite animal, but went with a squirrel instead. Getting the shape of a squirrel's head is harder than I thought, and in the end only the hind legs and tail seem to define the animal very clearly.

Made with the [Luxa](https://lospec.com/palette-list/luxa) palette. The restrictions on the colors really helped me focus on the important details of the squirrel.

### Isopod

#isopod is next. These are sea creatures with an exoskeletal body, much similar to shrimps. They look similar to a woodlice, if you know what that is, but an isopod is completely harmless. 

The insectoid figure of an isopod reminds me of the cover of Kafka's metamorphosis, so I decided to replace a normal isopod's face with that of a human. The picture on the wall also is a subtle reference to the portrait of a woman in Samsa's room in the book. [Blue Newspaper](https://lospec.com/palette-list/blue-newspaper) is the palette I chose for this piece. There's enough variety here for me to attempt ot shade the isopod's body.

### Berserk

The theme for the 5th day is #berserk. Here I decided to recreate one of the panels in the manga, with the composition altered a bit. Here instead of Griffith kneeling directly beneath the eclipse, he's a bit to the right.

Here I followed [MiniBoss](https://blog.studiominiboss.com/pixelart)'s tutorial on clouds. I attempted shading on the bottom of the clouds, but decided against it. In the end, I only used 3 of the 4 colors in [Blood Crow](https://lospec.com/palette-list/blood-crow).

I think this is my best pixel daily entry yet. The simplicity helps make things more readable, and for now I'll just stick to minimal shading like this until I can get a better grip on how lighting works.
